## Data Structure Specific Algorithms

### 1. Arrays
- **Sorting**  
  - QuickSort â†’ Efficient average-case (O(n log n))  
  - MergeSort â†’ Stable sort, useful when order matters (O(n log n))  
- **Searching**  
  - Binary Search â†’ Fast search in sorted arrays (O(log n))  
- **Two Pointers**  
  - In-place manipulation, often for sorted arrays (e.g., removing duplicates)  
- **Sliding Window**  
  - Subarray problems, finding maximum/minimum within a window  

### 2. Linked Lists
- Traversal â†’ Iterate through nodes  
- Insertion/Deletion â†’ At beginning, end, or specific position  
- Reversal â†’ In-place (iterative/recursive)  
- Cycle Detection â†’ Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm  

### 3. Hash Tables (Hash Maps/Sets)
- Understand hash functions  
- Insertion/Deletion/Lookup  
- Collision Handling  

### 4. Trees (Binary Trees, BST, etc.)
- Traversal â†’ Inorder, Preorder, Postorder (recursive/iterative)  
- Searching â†’ Find a node with given value (especially in BST)  

### 5. Stacks
- Push / Pop / Peek operations  

### 6. Queues
- Enqueue / Dequeue operations  

### 7. Heaps (Priority Queues)
- Insertion / Deletion (extract-min / max)  
- Build a Heap  
- Top K Elements â†’ Using heap for k largest/smallest elements  

### 8. Graphs
- Traversal â†’ BFS, DFS  
- Shortest Path â†’ Dijkstra's Algorithm  
- Cycle Detection â†’ DFS  

### 9. Tries
- Implement Trie from scratch  
- Insertion / Searching (words, prefixes)  
- Autocompletion â†’ Word suggestions  

### 10. Union-Find (Disjoint Set)
- Implement Union-Find from scratch  
- Find / Union operations  
- Cycle Detection in undirected graphs

## General Algorithms & Techniques

### 1. Recursion
- Define problems in terms of themselves  
- Examples: Factorial, Tree Traversals, DFS  

### 2. Dynamic Programming (DP)
- Break problem into overlapping subproblems  
- Store solutions to avoid recomputation  
- Examples: Fibonacci, Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence  

### 3. Greedy Algorithms
- Make locally optimal choices hoping for global optimum  
- Example: Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm (Minimum Spanning Tree)  

### 4. Backtracking
- Incrementally build solutions, explore all possible paths  
- Abandon invalid ones  
- Examples: Sudoku Solver, N-Queens, Generating Permutations
